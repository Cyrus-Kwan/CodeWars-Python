    "In a factory a printer labels for boxes. For one kind of boxes the printer has to use colors which, for the sake of simplicity, are named with letters from `a to m`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The colors used by the printer are recorded in a control string. For example a \"good\" control string would be `aaabbbbhaijjjm` meaning that the printer used three times color a, four times color b, one times color h then one time color a...\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes there are problems: lack of colors, technical malfuction and a \"bad\" control string is produced e.g. `aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm` with letters not from `a to m`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to write a function `printer_error` which given a string will return the error rate of the printer as a `string` representing a rational whose numerator is the number of errors and the denominator the length of the control string. Don't reduce this fraction to a simpler expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "The string has a length greater or equal to one and contains only letters from `a` to `z`.\n",
