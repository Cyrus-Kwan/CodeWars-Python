    "# Traffic Jam\n",
    "\n",
    "### Story\n",
    "Well, here I am stuck in another traffic jam.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Damn all those courteous people!*\n",
    "\n",
    "Cars are trying to enter the main road from side-streets somewhere ahead of me and people keep letting them cut in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time somebody is let in the effect ripples back down the reaod, so pretty soon I am not moving at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Sight... late again...)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visually\n",
    "The diagram bellow shows lots of cars all attempting to go North.\n",
    "- the `a`, `b`, `c`... cars are on the main road with me (`X`)\n",
    "- the `B` cars and `C` cars are merging from side streets\n",
    "\n",
    "> ```\n",
    ">           |  a  |   \n",
    ">           |  b  | ↑  \n",
    ">   --------+  c  |  \n",
    ">      BBBBBB  d  |   \n",
    ">   --------+  e  |  \n",
    ">           |  f  | ↑\n",
    ">           |  g  |   \n",

    ">       CCCCC  i  |\n",

    ">           |  m  |\n",
    ">           |  X  | \n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be represented as\n",
    "- `mainRoad` = `abcdefghijklmX`\n",
    "- `sideStreets` = `[\"\",\"\",\"\",\"BBBBBB\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"CCCCC\"]`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Kata Task\n",
    "Assume every car on the main road will \"give way\" to car 1 entering from each side street.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return a string representing the cars (up to and including me) in the order they exit off the top of the diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes\n",
    "- My car is the only `X`, and I am always on the main road\n",
    "- Other cars may be any alpha-numeric character (except `X` of course)\n",
    "- There are no \"gaps\" between street cars\n",
    "- Assume side streets are always on the left (as in the diagram)\n",
    "- The `sideStreets` array length may vary but is never more than the length of the main road\n",
    "- A pre-loaded `Util.display(maindRoad, sideStreets)` method is provided which may help to visualise the data\n",
    "- (Util.Display for C#)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "Here are the first few iterations of my example, showing that I am hardly moving at all...\n",
